### Problem (PMD): 'Double-brace initialization should be avoided' error
When: Running PMD checks as part of the build process.
Error: "[INFO] PMD Failure: [class] :22 Rule:DoubleBraceInitialization Priority:3
Double-brace initialization should be avoided."
Cause: Default PMD rules flag double-brace initialization.
Reference: https://pmd.github.io/pmd/pmd_rules_java_bestpractices.html#doublebraceinitialization
Causing code:

```
public void configure()
{
  Ex.configure()
      .context(new Context("/api/cats") {{
          invariant(new Invariant<Cat>() {{
              create(c -> "Black".equals(c.color), "Cats are born black");
          }});
          ...
```

Workaround 1: Adjust PMD rules.
```
  pmd-ruleset.xml:
    <rule ref="category/java/bestpractices.xml">
        <exclude name="DoubleBraceInitialization" />
```

Workaround 2: Use configure-with-builders style.
```
  Ex.configure()
    .context("/api/cats")
       .invariant(Cat.class)
         .create(c -> "Black".equals(c.color), "Cats are born black")
```
Details: Double-brace initialization creates an anonymous subclass, which is in
line with the code above. It is often overkill for collections, so PMD flags it
by default.
