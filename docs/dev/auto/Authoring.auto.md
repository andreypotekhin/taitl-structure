# Authoring automation

## Text processes
Text process is the process of creating documentation content from existing code and texts.
It can be automated (e.g. triggered by code changes on task completion), or manual (triggered with a task). 

Text process may be thought of as automated or semi-automated content pipeline.
Example: source annotation process is defined in [Annotation.auto.md](Annotation.auto.md). It is an automated process.

Text process definition includes the following:
- Establishes the scope, inputs and outputs (dirs). 
- Defines synchronization policy: e.g. source annotation automatically synchs on underlying code changes.
- Instructions on content transformation
- Points on authoring style/character
- Tips, notes, exceptions.

The process notation resembles a callable Python class, but is intended for communicating, not execution. 
Ex: Annotate(dir_name) invocation in an automation task. 

### Existing text processes
- Annotation, defined in [Annotation.auto.md](Annotation.auto.md).
- Documentation, defined in 'Documentation pipeline' section of [Documenting.md](../Documenting.md) 
and [Documenting.auto.md](Documenting.auto.md)

## Text operators
Text operator is a code-to-text or text-to-text transformation bearing certain authoring style,
e.g. optimized for brevity, generality etc.

Example:
- Annotation.auto.md defines annotate() text operator in subsections 'Example', 'General tips' of 'Creating annotated code' section. 
- It also describes how annotate() text operator applies to narrower contexts: 
  - Annotated source for example code. 
  - Annotated source for non-example code.

The operator notation resembles Python function call with named parameters, but is intended for communicating, not execution. 
Ex: annotate(dir_name) invocation in an automation task. 

Text operator definition only includes text transformation, not where to apply it,
so additional instructions (like dir_name parameter) is needed for invocation.

### Existing text operators
Existing text operators:
- baseline(): not explicitly mentioned, serving as baseline for all others 
  - defined by 'Documenting ...' sections of [Documenting.md](../Documenting.md) and [Style.md](../Style.md) 
- top_level(): defined by 
  - section 'End-User documentation' of [Documenting.md](../Documenting.md)
  - section 'End-User top-level documentation' of [Documenting.auto.md](Documenting.auto.md) 
- background(), reference(), recipes(): defined by
  - section 'End-User reference documentation' of [Documenting.auto.md](Documenting.auto.md)
  - section 'End-User documentation tips' of [Documenting.auto.md](Documenting.auto.md)
- developer(): defined by
  - section 'Developer documentation' of [Documenting.md](../Documenting.md)
  - sections 'Developer documentation - Top-level', 'Developer documentation - Other' of [Documenting.auto.md](Documenting.auto.md)
- annotate(): defined in subsections 'Example', 'General tips' of 'Creating annotated code' section of [Annotation.auto.md](Annotation.auto.md).
